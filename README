generates a spinning torus and continuously prints it to the screen until user
exits program (halts if editing parameters). rotations are computed using 
quaternions, but can be prescribed by the user in terms of roll/pitch/yaw
[RPY] (euler angles).

shape defaults to torus, but new functions can be defined by users in the form
z = f(x, y). functions are defined within the program api, and are stored in
shape.h. 

takes no input parameters.

usage:
  ./quonut

	launches the application in a new terminal
